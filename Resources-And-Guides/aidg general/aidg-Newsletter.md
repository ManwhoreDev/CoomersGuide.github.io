- (10/04) You can now toggle whether to use the newest AI for your model tier (Dragon, Griffin) available for your stories in Game Settings using the 'Newest AI Updates' toggle. Leaving it on allows you to utilize the latest AI improvements which may improve coherence, safety, and information retrieval along with associated testing. It appears to be an opt-in beta for the Universe solution they're testing.
- (29/03) Experimentation is underway by the developers regarding the injection of tags into the model's response processing, otherwise known as Universes. We've lovingly nicknamed it 'CYOAIDS' for its effect on quality while they were testing. This tech is how the Lovecraft model will be brought back, albeit more cost-effective (and possibly weaker than it was). More: <https://aidungeon.medium.com/ai-dungeon-universes-c73abe86cd1b>
